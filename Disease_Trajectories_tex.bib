	abstract = {The first edition in 1997 of A life course approach to chronic disease epidemiology became a classic text for epidemiological and public health researchers interested in the childhood origins of adult chronic disease. Since then the new field of life course epidemiology has expanded rapidly, attracting the interest not only of academics across the health and social sciences but also policy makers, funding bodies, and the general public. Its purpose is to study how biological and social factors during gestation, childhood, adolescence and earlier adult life independently, cumulatively and interactively influence later life health and disease. Contributors to this fully revised second edition capture the excitement of the developing field and assess the latest evidence regarding sources of risk to health across the life course and across generations. The original chapters on life course influences on cardiovascular disease, diabetes, blood pressure, respiratory disease and cancer have been updated and extended. New chapters on life course influences on obesity, biological ageing and neuropsychiatric disorders have been added. Life course explanations for disease trends and for socioeconomic differentials in disease risk are given more attention in this new edition, reflecting recent developments in the field. The section on policy implications has been expanded, assessing the role of interventions to improve childhood social circumstances, as well as interventions to improve early growth. Emerging new research themes and the theoretical and methodological challenges facing life course epidemiology are highlighted.},

	abstract = {For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual’s disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual’s disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions–the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters ofﬂine, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-speciﬁc parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in predictive accuracy.},

	abstract = {Objectives  To examine access to palliative care between different disease trajectories and compare to other geographic areas. Design  A retrospective population-based decedent cohort study using linked administrative data. Setting  Ontario, Canada. Participants  Ontario decedents between 1 April 2010 and 31 December 2012. Patients were categorised into disease trajectories: terminal illness (eg, cancer), organ failure (eg, chronic heart failure), frailty (eg, dementia), sudden death or other. Interventions  Receipt of palliative care services from institutional and community settings, derived from a validated list of palliative care codes from multiple administrate databases. Outcome measures  Receiving any palliative care services in the last year of life (yes/no), intensity (total days) and time of initiation of palliative care, in hospital and community sectors. Multivariable analysis examined the association between disease trajectory and the receipt of palliative care in the last year of life.
Results  We identified 235 159 decedents in Ontario. In the last year of life, 88\% of terminal illness, 44\% of organ failure and 32\% of frailty decedents accessed at least one palliative care service. Most care was provided during an inpatient hospitalisation. Terminal illness decedents received twice as many palliative care days (mean of 49 days) compared with organ failure and frailty decedents. Patients with terminal illness initiated palliative care median of 107 days before death compared with median of 19 days among those using the US Medicare hospice benefit.
Conclusions  Terminal illness decedents are more likely to receive any palliative care, with increased intensity and earlier before death than organ failure or frailty decedents. These data serve as a useful comparison for other countries with similar and different healthcare systems and eligibility criteria.},

	abstract = {Background: In drug development, it is important to have an understanding of the full spectrum of co-morbidities to be expected in the group of patients with the disease of interest. It is usually a challenge to identify the less common events associated with the target disease, even if these events are severe. The purpose of this study is to identify co-morbidities associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as compared with a control group, using a large health care database.
Methods: Marketscan US claims database was used for this retrospective cohort study. Selected were records of persons aged at least 16 Y with at least two claims for RA, and with active insurance status on June 30,2007. The control group had at least two claims for eczema/dermatitis. Controls were matched by age, gender and insurance status (Medicare or not). All co-morbidities with an ICD9 diagnostic code were identified in the RA and control groups, during a one-year window. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated. Diagnoses were rank-ordered by magnitude of RR. Codes covering RA and arthropathy were excluded. In order to get stable estimates, rank-ordering was performed for diagnoses occurring in at least 20 persons in the control group.
Results: Records were selected of 62,681 persons with RA (mean age was 59.0 Y, with 73.8\% female, Medicarecovered 35\%). A total of 6897 different ICD9 diagnostic codes were recorded, with 2220 codes in at least 20 persons of the control group [listed with Relative Risk]. Apart from joint/bone related conditions, strong associations with RA (RR {\textgreater} 3) were found for Adverse effect medicinal and biological substance not elsewhere classified, Unspecified adverse effect drug properly administered, Idiopathic fibrosing alveolitis, Osteomyelitis, Immune deficiency, Elevated sedimentation rate, Tuberculin test reaction abnormal or positive, Anemia and Cushing syndrome.
Conclusions: Data on a large number ({\textgreater} 60,000) of patients with a diagnosis of RA were used to analyze and to list a large number ({\textgreater}2,000) of co-morbidities. Rank-ordering of RRs of diagnostic codes is a tool to identify quickly many conditions associated with RA.},

	abstract = {Electronic health records contain large amounts of longitudinal data that are valuable for biomedical informatics research. The application of machine learning is a promising alternative to manual analysis of such data. However, the complex structure of the data, which includes clinical events that are unevenly distributed over time, poses a challenge for standard learning algorithms. Some approaches to modeling temporal data rely on extracting single values from time series; however, this leads to the loss of potentially valuable sequential information. How to better account for the temporality of clinical data, hence, remains an important research question. In this study, novel representations of temporal data in electronic health records are explored. These representations retain the sequential information, and are directly compatible with standard machine learning algorithms. The explored methods are based on symbolic sequence representations of time series data, which are utilized in a number of different ways. An empirical investigation, using 19 datasets comprising clinical measurements observed over time from a real database of electronic health records, shows that using a distance measure to random subsequences leads to substantial improvements in predictive performance compared to using the original sequences or clustering the sequences. Evidence is moreover provided on the quality of the symbolic sequence representation by comparing it to sequences that are generated using domain knowledge by clinical experts. The proposed method creates representations that better account for the temporality of clinical events, which is often key to prediction tasks in the biomedical domain.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the ability of initial medication dispensings to predict long-term patterns of adherence. Study Design: A retrospective cohort study of statin initiators enrolled in a Medicare Part D drug plan from CVS Caremark from 2005 to 2008.
Methods: We used group-based trajectory models to classify patients into 6 adherence trajectories based on patterns of statin filling over the year following therapy initiation. Baseline clinical characteristics and indicators of statin filling during the first 2 to 4 months following initiation were used to predict adherence trajectory in logistic regression models, separately within strata of the days’ supply of the initial statin dispensing. Cross-validation was used to measure predictive accuracy of models in data not used for model estimation.
Results: Among 77,703 statin initiators, prediction using baseline variables only was poor (cross-validated C statistic ≤0.61). When using 3 months of initial adherence to predict trajectory, prediction was greatly improved among patients with an index supply ≤30 days (0.62 ≤C ≤0.91). With 4 months of initial adherence in the model, prediction was strong for all patients (C ≥0.72), especially for the best and worst trajectories (C = 0.90 and 0.94, respectively, in patients with an index supply ≤30 days; and C = 0.83 and 0.90, respectively, in patients with an index supply {\textgreater}30 days).
Conclusions: Initial filling behavior strongly predicted future adherence trajectory. Predicting adherence trajectories may facilitate better targeting of interventions to patients most likely to benefit.},

However, many complex chronic diseases exhibit large degrees of heterogeneity, and furthermore there is not always a single readily available biomarker to quantify disease severity. Even when such a clinical variable exists, there are often additional related biomarkers that may help improve prediction of future disease state. To this end, we propose a novel probabilistic generative model for multivariate longitudinal data that captures dependencies between multivariate trajectories of clinical variables. We use a Gaussian process based regression model for each individual trajectory, and build oﬀ ideas from latent class models to induce dependence between their mean functions. We develop a scalable variational inference algorithm that we use to ﬁt our model to a large dataset of longitudinal electronic patient health records. Our model’s dynamic predictions have signiﬁcantly lower errors compared to a recent state of the art method for modeling disease trajectories, and they are being incorporated into a population health rounding tool to be used by clinicians at our local accountable care organization.},

We introduce DeepCare, an end-to-end deep dynamic neural network that reads medical records, stores previous illness history, infers current illness states and predicts future medical outcomes. At the data level, DeepCare represents care episodes as vectors and models patient health state trajectories by the memory of historical records. Built on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), DeepCare introduces methods to handle irregularly timed events by moderating the forgetting and consolidation of memory. DeepCare also explicitly models medical interventions that change the course of illness and shape future medical risk. Moving up to the health state level, historical and present health states are then aggregated through multiscale temporal pooling, before passing through a neural network that estimates future outcomes. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of DeepCare for disease progression modeling, intervention recommendation, and future risk prediction. On two important cohorts with heavy social and economic burden – diabetes and mental health – the results show improved prediction accuracy.},

Such circumstances tend to drive revolutionary, rather than incremental, change. The current approach to preoperative assessment, that typically occurs in the weeks leading up to surgery, but is all too often only a few days before surgery, results in a lost opportunity for perioperative physicians to improve patient care. Re-engineering this process based on a patient-focused, pathway-driven vision of perioperative medicine offers a means of exploiting this opportunity. This review explores drivers for change, the opportunity offered by pathway re-design, and suggests a variety of strategies to add value in the preoperative pathway, each of which is facilitated by early engagement between perioperative physician and patient: collaborative decision-making, collaborative behavioural change, targeted comorbidity management as well as expectation management and psychological preparation for surgery including surgery schools.},

	abstract = {The recent years have witnessed a surge of interests in data analytics with patient Electronic Health Records (EHR). Data-driven healthcare, which aims at eﬀective utilization of big medical data, representing the collective learning in treating hundreds of millions of patients, to provide the best and most personalized care, is believed to be one of the most promising directions for transforming healthcare. EHR is one of the major carriers for make this data-driven healthcare revolution successful. There are many challenges on working directly with EHR, such as temporality, sparsity, noisiness, bias, etc. Thus eﬀective feature extraction, or phenotyping from patient EHRs is a key step before any further applications. In this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for phenotyping from patient EHRs. We ﬁrst represent the EHRs for every patient as a temporal matrix with time on one dimension and event on the other dimension. Then we build a fourlayer convolutional neural network model for extracting phenotypes and perform prediction. The ﬁrst layer is composed of those EHR matrices. The second layer is a one-side convolution layer that can extract phenotypes from the ﬁrst layer. The third layer is a max pooling layer introducing sparsity on the detected phenotypes, so that only those signiﬁcant phenotypes will remain. The fourth layer is a fully connected softmax prediction layer. In order to incorporate the temporal smoothness of the patient EHR, we also investigated three diﬀerent temporal fusion mechanisms in the model: early fusion, late fusion and slow fusion. Finally the proposed model is validated on a real world EHR data warehouse under the speciﬁc scenario of predictive modeling of chronic diseases.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives The illness trajectory in the last year of life in advanced (stage 5) chronic kidney disease is poorly understood. Mapping the trajectory of patient-centered outcomes could facilitate better care. The objectives of this study were to determine trajectories of symptoms and wider health-related concerns in the last year of life in stage 5 chronic kidney disease, managed without dialysis. Design, setting, participants, \& measurements A longitudinal symptom survey in three UK renal units was used, using the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale–Short Form and core Palliative Care Outcome Scale. Average (using mean scores over time) and individual (using individual scores over time, with visual graphical analysis) trajectories were mapped.
Results Seventy-four patients (mean age, 81 Ϯ 6.8 years) were recruited; 49 died during follow-up. Average trajectories showed moderate symptom distress and health-related concerns, with marked increase in the last 2 months of life. Visual graphical analysis enabled stable, increasing, or fluctuant individual trajectories to be identified. The proportion following these trajectories varied between outcome measures; regarding symptoms, 50\% followed a stable pattern, 24\% increased, and 21\% fluctuated compared with 26\%, 57\%, and 21\%, respectively, for health-related concerns. Inter-rater agreement in grouping trajectories was high (␬ statistic, 0.80 and 0.86, respectively).
Conclusions In the 2 months before death, patients reported a sharp increase in symptom distress and health-related concerns. Health care should anticipate and address this increase, which may indicate the patients is approaching death. Considerable individual variation and flexibility/responsiveness of care is important: one size of service does not fit all.

	abstract = {A stochastic Markov chain model for metastatic progression is developed for primary lung cancer based on a network construction of metastatic sites with dynamics modeled as an ensemble of random walkers on the network. We calculate a transition matrix, with entries (transition probabilities) interpreted as random variables, and use it to construct a circular bi-directional network of primary and metastatic locations based on postmortem tissue analysis of 3827 autopsies on untreated patients documenting all primary tumor locations and metastatic sites from this population. The resulting 50 potential metastatic sites are connected by directed edges with distributed weightings, where the site connections and weightings are obtained by calculating the entries of an ensemble of transition matrices so that the steady-state distribution obtained from the long-time limit of the Markov chain dynamical system corresponds to the ensemble metastatic distribution obtained from the autopsy data set. We condition our search for a transition matrix on an initial distribution of metastatic tumors obtained from the data set. Through an iterative numerical search procedure, we adjust the entries of a sequence of approximations until a transition matrix with the correct steady-state is found (up to a numerical threshold). Since this constrained linear optimization problem is underdetermined, we characterize the statistical variance of the ensemble of transition matrices calculated using the means and variances of their singular value distributions as a diagnostic tool. We interpret the ensemble averaged transition probabilities as (approximately) normally distributed random variables. The model allows us to simulate and quantify disease progression pathways and timescales of progression from the lung position to other sites and we highlight several key findings based on the model.},

At present, both the extraction of data and methods for analyses are frequently designed to work with a single snapshot of a patient’s record. Health care providers often perform and record actions in small batches over time. By extracting these care events, a sequence can be formed providing a trajectory for a patient’s interactions with the health care system. These care events also offer a basic heuristic for the level of attention a patient receives from health care providers. We show that is possible to learn meaningful embeddings from these care events using two deep learning techniques, unsupervised autoencoders and long short-term memory networks. We compare these methods to traditional machine learning methods which require a point in time snapshot to be extracted from an EHR.},

However, the analysis accuracy is reduced when the quality of medical data is incomplete. Moreover, different regions exhibit unique characteristics of certain regional diseases, which may weaken the prediction of disease outbreaks. In this paper, we streamline machine learning algorithms for effective prediction of chronic disease outbreak in disease-frequent communities. We experiment the modified prediction models over real-life hospital data collected from central China in 2013-2015. To overcome the difficulty of incomplete data, we use a latent factor model to reconstruct the missing data. We experiment on a regional chronic disease of cerebral infarction. We propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multimodal disease risk prediction algorithm using structured and unstructured data from hospital. To the best of our knowledge, none of the existing work focused on both data types in the area of medical big data analytics. Compared with several typical prediction algorithms, the prediction accuracy of our proposed algorithm reaches 94.8\% with a convergence speed, which is faster than that of the CNN-based unimodal disease risk prediction algorithm.},

Simultaneously, rapid progress has been made in clinical analytics—techniques for analyzing large quantities of data and gleaning new insights from that analysis—which is part of what is known as           big data           . As a result, there are unprecedented opportunities to use big data to reduce the costs of health care in the United States. We present six use cases—that is, key examples—where some of the clearest opportunities exist to reduce costs through the use of big data: high-cost patients, readmissions, triage, decompensation (when a patient’s condition worsens), adverse events, and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems. We discuss the types of insights that are likely to emerge from clinical analytics, the types of data needed to obtain such insights, and the infrastructure—analytics, algorithms, registries, assessment scores, monitoring devices, and so forth—that organizations will need to perform the necessary analyses and to implement changes that will improve care while reducing costs. Our findings have policy implications for regulatory oversight, ways to address privacy concerns, and the support of research on analytics.},
